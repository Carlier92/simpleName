  <h1>CSS Introduction</h1>
  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

    <li><b>CSS</b> stands for <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heets</li>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
    <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
  <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations<br>
    in display for different devices and screen sizes.
  </p>
  <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
  <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!<br>
    HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:<br>
    &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
    When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.<br>
    To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.<br>
    CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
