            <p>If you want to write semantic markup – and believe us, you do want to write
              semantic markup – then you need to structure HTML documents properly. The html,
              head, and body elements have been part of the HTML specification since the mid
              1990s, and up until a few years ago they were the primary elements used to give
              structure to HTML documents. However, the situation has changed dramatically in
              the last few years as HTML5 has added a slew of new tags that can be used to add
              rich semantic meaning to the structure of an HTML document.</p>
